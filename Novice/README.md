 ### Fibonacci Sequence
 Simply put, the Fibonacci sequence is a sequence in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones ie. $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$

 Write a program which find the nth term in the sequence. Your function should poses a single integer parameter and return the resulting term in the Fibonacci sequence.  

 There are three methods of solving this problem; there is a recursive brute force solution which solves this problem from the top down, a bottom up solution which removes the need for recursion, and an improved version of the bottom up solution which reduced space complexity.

 All solutions can be found below:
  - [Python solutions](Fib.py)
  - [C solutions](Fib.c)
  - [C++ solutions](Fib.cpp)
  - [Java solutions](Fib.java)
